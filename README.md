# 100 days of DSA PROBLEMS in C
##### This repository contains daily implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms problems in C as part of a structured 100-day learning challenge.

## DAY 1
- Question 1 - A C program that inserts an element at a given 1-based position in an array by shifting existing elements to the right.
- Question 2 - A C implementation of the Two Sum problem that returns indices of two array elements whose sum equals a target value using a hash-based approach.
